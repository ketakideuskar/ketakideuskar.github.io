          <h3 class="header">What I Learned</h3>
          <p></p>
          <h4 class="list-header">Team culture</h4><p class="content" style="display: inline;"> is so so SO important. I cannot emphasize this enough. Intel is a huge company and an easy way to make it smaller was by connecting with my team. The intern community in my team was awesome! My internship was a little weird because my mentors were separated from the team I worked under. However, the interns were super friendly and made Intel’s campus a lot smaller. We grew pretty close and even went on a rafting trip :). In terms of the actual team, everyone was incredibly helpful and tried to get to know me. Although I got to know them later in my internship, I still felt included in birthday celebrations and team bonding activities. Throughout this internship, I have learned that team culture is high up on what I want in a future job.</p>
          <p></p>
          <h4 class="list-header">Asking questions is okay.</h4> <p class="content" style="display: inline;"> When I first began my internship, I was completely lost for the first few weeks. In hindsight, this was completely normal for the ramp-up process. But in the moment, I was really questioning my abilities as a computer scientist and a problem solver. How could I ever become a software engineer if I couldn’t even set up my system properly? Turns out that all I had to do was ask. My mentors were the most essential part of my internship. They gave me advice ranging from potential causes of a bug to my future career goals. And they were just an IM away! I learned that no question is a stupid question and that your mentors are truly there to help you. </p>
          <p></p>
          <h4 class="list-header">Systems</h4> <p class="content" style="display: inline;"> are super cool! I honestly didn’t think I had any interest in hardware but I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it wasn’t as scary as I thought it was. I got experience in setting up the system’s operating system, adding memory, and flashing the BIOS. Personally, I feel like learning about how the hardware interacts with the software (and my code) helped me understand systems more in depth. Although I don’t want to pursue a career in hardware, it was interesting to learn what happens when you program at such a low level. Overall, I would say it was a cool experience!</p>
